This is a text based morse code translator program

It provides the following options that a user can interact with:

  1. Encode to Morse Code
  2. Decode from Morse Code
  3. Play Morse Sound
  4. Morse Sound Settings

In the above options, 
  1: asks for a string in the form of aplha/numerical values and it will encode it into morse code
  2: asks for a string in the form of morse code to decode it into alpha/numerical format
  3: It can play the previously encoded morse code from option "1:" and it will play it audio format, or you can pass in a new string of alpha/numerical to be played in morse code
  4: Morse Sound Settings allows you to adjust to the pitch or the speed in which the audio for your morse code is played in

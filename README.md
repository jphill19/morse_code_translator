# Morse Code Translator Terminal Application

## Purpose
This is a text-based Morse Code translator designed for terminal use. It allows users to encode, decode, and play Morse Code, with customizable audio settings for pitch and speed, utilizing Python libraries for sound generation.

## Features
1. **Encode to Morse Code**  
   - Converts an alphanumeric input string into Morse Code.

2. **Decode from Morse Code**  
   - Translates a Morse Code string back into alphanumeric characters.

3. **Play Morse Code Sound**  
   - Plays the previously encoded Morse Code in audio format.
   - Alternatively, you can input a new alphanumeric string to hear its Morse Code representation.

4. **Morse Sound Settings**  
   - Adjust the **pitch** and **speed** of the Morse Code audio playback for customization.

## Users
This application is suitable for individuals interested in learning or experimenting with Morse Code. It can serve educational purposes, hobbyist exploration, or general interest.

## Technology
- **Programming Language**: Python (tested on Python 3.x)
- **Libraries**:
  - `pyaudio`: For generating and playing audio.
  - `numpy`: For handling numeric computations required for audio synthesis.

## Platform
- **Terminal Application**: Designed for use in a terminal environment. It has been tested on Windows and Linux.

# How to Use

1. Launch the application in your terminal.
2. Select one of the following options:
   - **1: Encode to Morse Code**  
     Input an alphanumeric string, and the application will output the corresponding Morse Code.
   - **2: Decode from Morse Code**  
     Input a Morse Code string (using dots and dashes), and the application will output the decoded alphanumeric text.
   - **3: Play Morse Code Sound**  
     Plays the Morse Code audio for the last encoded string or allows you to input a new alphanumeric string for playback.
   - **4: Morse Sound Settings**  
     Customize the **pitch** and **speed** of the Morse Code audio playback.
